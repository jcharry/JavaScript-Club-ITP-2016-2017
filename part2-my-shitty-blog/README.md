#Part 2 - A simple blog with a simple login#
Built using Node/Express for server logic, and Javascript for loading dynamic content

For this exercise, we'll pretend that we have a bunch of blog data (stored in data.json) for different users, but in order to see the data for a specific user, you'll have to login to the page. If we have time, we'll format the output with CSS.

Topics Covered:
1. Basic server side programming with Node/Express
2. HTTP Requests
3. HTML Forms
4. AJAX with jQuery
5. Basic DOM manipulation with vanilla javascript

##Setup##
1. Ensure node is installed on your computer. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jcharry/JavaScript-Club-ITP-2016-2017.git
  ```
  This will create a folder with the contents of this git repository
3. In your terminal, navigate to the folder with:
  ```bash
  cd ~/path/to/Javascript-Club-ITP-2016-2017/part2-my-shitty-blog
  ```
4. Once there, run the following command in your terminal
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  This will install all the dependencies we need to run our app
5. Start the server by running:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
6. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app running

##Making Changes##
If you make any changes to the server.js file, remember to restart your server
using CTRL-C, and rerun ```node server.js```
