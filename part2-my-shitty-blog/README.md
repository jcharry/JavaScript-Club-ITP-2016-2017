#My Shitty Blog - A tutorial#
Built using Node/Express for server logic, and Javascript for loading dynamic
content

For this exercise, we'll pretend that we have a bunch of blog data (stored in
data.json) for different users, but in order to see the data for a specific user, you'll have
to login to the page.  If we have time, we'll format the output with CSS.
