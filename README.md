#JavaScript Club ITP 2016-2017
A place to get together, learn some JavaScript, and make cool stuff on the web

#Topics to potentially cover
1. The basics of the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript without p5)
2. The Web Developer Stack (why are there so many tools!?)
3. jQuery, AJAX
4. Github
5. Ssh-ing into servers, heroku deploy
6. Task runners (gulp, grunt, webpack)
7. Node, npm, and basic server side programming
8. Functional Programming vs. Object-oriented programming
9. JavaScript Design Patterns
10. React (all the cool kids are talking about it, or something)
11. D3.js - Make pretty charts!
12. Three.js - Make things in 3D!
13. Twitter bots with Node

#Things you'll need
1. A text editor (the p5 editor won't cut it for our needs)
	1. I'd recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or
       [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
2. An understanding that confusion is natural, and that eventually, things will start to make sense
